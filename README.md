## Unix Chatbot
This bot provides simple unix commanands when prompted by the user. The bot is capable of providing commands to list files, view contents of files and replace words in a file. It can also help with commands to copy, move and delete a file. 


## Motivation
I have always been fascinated in Chatbots and have been wanting to create my own. I came across a video of Open AI using their API to translate natural language to unix commands and I wanted to try to build a more simplified version of this using Python's data science took kit.
