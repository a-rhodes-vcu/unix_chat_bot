## Unix Chatbot
This bot provides simple unix commanands when prompted by the user. The bot is capable of providing commands to list files, view contents of files, replace words in a file. It can also help with commands to copy, move and delete a file. 


## Motivation
I have always been fascinated in Chatbots and have been wanting to create my own. I came across a video of Open AI using their API to translate natural language to unix commands. I wanted to replicate this example on my own.
